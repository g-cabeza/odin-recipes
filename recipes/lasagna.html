    <h2>The best italian plate to treat yourself!</h2>
        <p>Lasagna was one of the first dishes I learned to make in college. The early attempts were based on an easy lasagna recipe that kept dishes to a minimum but still provided plenty of leftovers. When I would cook it, the irresistible aroma of melting cheese and robust pasta sauce would waft down the hall. It earned me a reputation as the cook on my floor. Before long, I started doubling the lasagna ingredients to make it in a huge disposable pan—perfect for feeding a crowd or for holiday occasions.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Lasagna Noodles</li>
            <li>Sausage and ground beef</li>
            <li>Crushed tomatoes and tomato paste</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Cheese</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Hot to make Lasagna</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil the pasta: Skip this step if you’re using fresh pasta, no-boil noodles or oven-ready noodles.</li>
            <li>Prepare the lasagna ingredients: Cook the meat, make a sauce and prepare any cheesy fillings.</li>
            <li>Make the layers: Fill the casserole dish with layers of sauce, noodles and cheese. Starting with sauce on the bottom keeps the noodles from sticking.</li>
            <li>Rest before slicing: Resting is often overlooked, but it’s the secret to preventing a soupy mess on the plate.</li>
        </ol>

    <h3>How to layer lasagna</h3>
        <p>To layer the lasagna ingredients, alternate adding sauce, noodles and cheese to the casserole dish. Then repeat! Always start with sauce on the bottom of the baking dish to keep the noodles from sticking, and finish the top layers with cheese for visual appeal. Most 13×9-inch baking dishes will fit about three layers. Once layered, the lasagna can be baked immediately or saved for later.</p>

    <h3>How long to bake lasagna</h3>
        <p>We cook this lasagna at 375°F for 50 minutes (25 minutes covered and 25 minutes uncovered). The uncovered portion is key to ensuring the cheese topping browns to golden perfection. Cooking times may vary if you use no-boil or oven-ready noodles.</p>
